Evans arrives at Fleck's loft mansion. He lugged his guitar behind him. First, they talked about the ways natural language processing was similar in some regards to Evan's graph research. Soon, Fleck pulled out her flute and played a mellow tune. Evans strummed slowly and in pace with the flute. The sweet, but somber music rose and hung in the air as if it were a heavenly apparition. Evans set down his guitar. Although he did not want to leave, he knew he had work to get done. He quickly thanked Fleck for a great day and hurried back home before it got too dark.
