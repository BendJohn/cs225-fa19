Evans breathed out a sigh. Maybe inceptron was a figment of his imagination. Perhaps he would try again tomorrow. He finds his bed and goes to sleep. In his dreams, he is haunted by vivid dreams of people shouting. A man with scruffy beard running toward him. Evans remembers. Atleast he thinks so. A girl came up to him, shaking visibly. He knew he loved her, but he did not understand why or how. He woke up as he had the nights before, sweat streaming down his face. He could run another simulation, or he could repeat this cycle of dreams, grasping and the little bits of comfort he had in sleep.

# sleep-again
He was simply too tired. He decides to sleep again.

# run-another-sim
He resolved in his mind to run another simulation.
