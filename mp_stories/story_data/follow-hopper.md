Hopper brough Evans to her secret laboratory. It was something plain but very futurastic. The walls were made of a metallic color but they were bent and curved like a mad artist claiming his messy art was beautiful.

"You are in danger" Hopper said.

"Me? Why?!" Evans asked.

"You are looking for something. Something that powerful people dont want you to find." Hopper said.
She said it very matter-of-factly.

"Inceptron? What do you know about it?" Evans demanded.

"I cant tell you." Hopper replied.
Evans sighed. Why was he wasting his time with this Hopper look-alike.

"... but I can show you" Hopper finished. She fished something from her pocket. "First you must choose the red pill or the blue pill. If you take the blue pill, you can go back to your comfortable life. Living out your days as an esteemed CS professor. Forget you ever heard about inceptron"
Evans thought about it. All inceptron did was cause him trouble.

"Or you can take the red pill, and give up your life of leisure. Even though life will become difficult, atleast you will know what you experience is real." Hopper said.
Real? What was that supposed to mean? For all Evans knew, this Hopper lady could be trying to poison him. But on the otherhand, that was what got him interested in inceptron in the first place. The persuit of truth.

He decided to take the red pill. He had to know what inceptron was.

# the-blue-pill
The risk was too high. Evans preferred to stay safe and enjoy the life he has
