"I know what you are looking for. Follow the shortest leaf." Evans blinked. The message was always the same. He had run into these before and he now discarded them as nonsense. His phone flickered. Three of his professor buddies had texted him. They all wanted to hang out. First was Mattox Beckman. Usually Evans and Beckman would have a discussion on compilers and other low-level things. Their conversation would slowly drift over to philosophy and theology, asking about life-altering questions. Second was Margaret Fleck. Fleck was instrested in natural language processing. But soon she would begin playing music. She played the flute and usually prompted Evans to play the guitar. Lastly, there was Evan Delucia. Evans and Delucia had very little in common. Delucia was interested in collecting and studying different types of roots. Which one should he choose?

# go-talk-beckman
Evans was in the mood for a little low-level talk. He replies to Beckman.

# go-play-music
Evans loved to play his guitar. He let's Fleck know that he's coming.

# go-root-collecting
Evans slowly nods. Yes, he would like to go root collecting.

# run-another-sim
Evans shakes his head. "I need to run something for my work," he texts them all that he is too busy.

# go-to-bed
Evans shakes his head. "I was just napping, and I'm still pretty tired. Maybe next time." he replies to all of them.
